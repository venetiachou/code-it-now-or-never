# code-it-now-or-never

Hi,

Here is the very first project I build to learn HTML, CSS, and javascript.

I'll spend 7-10 hours every week to learn how it works in 2 months.

I wanna record this whole process. Also publishing it will keep me go on this project. So that's why you see it.

I just started on March 10. Let's see how far I'll go.

## W1 3/10
- Basic HTML tag(H1, div, form, table etc.)
- HTML5 tag(Header, nav, main)
- Facebook Fanpage & Google map
