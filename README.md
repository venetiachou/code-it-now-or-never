# code-it-now-or-never
Hello, there
Here is the very first project I build to learn HTML, CSS, and javascript.
I'll spend a whole day every week to learn how it works.
Cause I wanna record this whole process. Also publishing will keep me going on this project.
So that's why you see it.

I just started in the very basic knowledge on March 10.
Let's see how it will be.
